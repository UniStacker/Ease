# **Ease**

Welcome to Ease — a programming language that’s… kind of trying its best right now.  

This is a personal project I started because, well, why not? Ease is meant to be beginner-friendly (eventually) and easy to read (hopefully). Right now, though? It’s a bit of a mess. You can create variables, print stuff, and... not much else. But hey, we all start somewhere, right?

## **What’s Working?**

Currently, Ease can do the following (sometimes without breaking):  
1. Create variables (strings, numbers, and floating-point numbers).  
2. Print output using the `say` keyword.  
3. Print variables inside strings with `{}`.  

That’s it. I know, it’s not much. But Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither was Ease.

## **What’s Not Working?**

Oh boy, where do I start?  

- You can’t assign one variable to another.  
- No math inside strings (like `{2 + 2}`).  
- Limited to printing and variables. Don’t expect loops, conditionals, or anything fancy.  
- Bugs. Bugs everywhere.

## **Contributing**

Feel like helping out? Great! Submit an issue, suggest a feature, or just point out everything that’s wrong with the code. Constructive criticism is welcome; roasting me is optional.

## **Final Thoughts**

Ease is a work-in-progress, much like its creator. If you’re here, thanks for checking it out. Stick around to see where it goes — or don’t. Your call.  

Happy coding!
